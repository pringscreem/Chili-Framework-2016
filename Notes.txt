	-Useful Visual Studio tips: F5 to start with Debugger
								arrows to move up/down the list of suggestions in Intellisense
								tab to select the current suggestion from Intellisense

	  //shift + ctrl + space to pull up Intellisense function info

	  ****The abstraction of xMax etc. was much faster to deal with than the actual numbers themselves.

	  ****It doesn't like it when you call library functions during the declaration of a variable (i.e. srand problems)

	  ****Generally speaking, variables are what makes code portable: functions that take variables instead of using their access to
	      class member variables are easier to reuse.

	****The Debugger seems to be a useful way to find the general location of an error so that 
	****you don't have to read the entire source code to find the bug.

	**********Chat-GPT is excellent for syntax questions e.g. How to not overwrite text in output file**********

	*****The semi-colon after classes is a common error (reminder)*****
